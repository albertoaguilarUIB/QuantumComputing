# Quantum Computing

This repository contains a couple of documents and Python scrips related to quantum computing. At the moment, there is the following material.

- A description of **Shor's algorithm** for factoring large integers, including a **simulation** in Python
- An introduction to the mathematical foundations of **quantum error correction**, i.e. simple codes, the stabilizer formalism, toric codes and surface codes
- A description of the **quantum phase estimation** algorithm, including its relation to Shor's algorithm and several applications, for instance **matrix inversion**
- Material on **implementations** of quantum computers, specifically **superconducting qubits** based on Josephson junctions and quantum computing based on **nuclear magnetic resonance**, including a few Python notebooks
- a few **Python notebooks** that demonstrate how to work with IBMs Qiskit framework are collected in the directory Qiskit
