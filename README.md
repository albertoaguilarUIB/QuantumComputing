# Quantum Computing

This repository contains a couple of documents and Python scrips related to quantum computing. At the moment, there is the following material.

- A description of **Shor's algorithm** for factoring large integers, including a **simulation** in Python
- An introduction to the mathematical foundations of **quantum error correction**, i.e. simple codes, the stabilizer formalism, toric codes and surface codes
- A description of the **quantum phase estimation** algorithm, including its relation to Shor's algorithm and several applications, for instance **matrix inversion**
- Material on **implementations** of quantum computers, specifically **superconducting qubits** based on Josephson junctions and quantum computing based on **nuclear magnetic resonance**, including a few Python notebooks
- a few **Python notebooks** that demonstrate how to work with IBMs Qiskit framework are collected in the directory Qiskit - this currently includes example code for **quantum Fourier transform**, the **Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm**, **Shor's algorithm**, **Quantum Teleportation** and simulating a **Hydrogen molecule** 

Of course all these implementations and documents have been created for educational purposes and are not intended for production use - feel free to play with them and modify them if needed. When you use or cite this code or the documentation, please add a reference to this site or my blog www.leftasexercise.com.
